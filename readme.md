This project is aimed to throw together DOM manipulation and to test if
a firm grasp on the connection between html, css, and js  has been learned.
A program close to an etch-a-sketch will be made, heavily testing
event listener behavior control and putting an entire project
together into a coherent, functioning page 
with plenty of interactivity baked into it.
